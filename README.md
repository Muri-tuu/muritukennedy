## 👋 About Me

I'm **Kennedy Muritu**, a purpose-driven full-stack developer and creative technologist operating at the intersection of **engineering excellence**, **creative expression**, and **meaningful innovation**. Currently pursuing Mechatronics Engineering at Murang'a University of Technology (Class of 2026), I build interconnected digital ecosystems that blend technical depth with cultural storytelling.

**Philosophy:** *"To build is to serve. Every line of code, every pixel of design — is a step toward meaning."*

I don't just build software — I architect experiences. My work bridges the gap between cutting-edge technology and human-centered design, with a focus on systems that scale, stories that resonate, and solutions that matter.

## 💡 Technical Approach

I think in **systems, not features**. My development philosophy centers on:

- **Modular Architecture:** Building reusable, scalable components from the start
- **Full-Stack Thinking:** Designing what I build, building what I envision
- **Creative-Technical Fusion:** Equal weight to functionality and aesthetics
- **Execution Bias:** Moving rapidly from concept to prototype
- **Purpose-First:** Every project must serve a meaningful goal
